                    <p class="mb-0">
                        Honeybees are ectothermic creatures, meaning their regulation of body temperature depends on external sources. 
                        Thus, honeybee activity is often tied to natural weather processes and temperatures. 
                        A shift in global temperature from climate change poses a threat to honeybee biology, behavior and distribution, 
                        where floral resources and natural enemies may bear different reactions to the changing climate, and thus impede on a hive's effectiveness 
                        with regards to the pollination process.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="mt-5">Climate Change and Honeybee Biology</h2>
                    <p class="mb-0">
                        Global climate change is defined as a lasting change in the statistical distribution of weather patterns over periods ranging from decades to millions of years.
                        This includes shifts in temperature in both extremes, and changes in frequency and intensity of precipitation, which can directly affect a honeybee's physiology and
                        behavior. Many species of pollinators, and organisms in general, often employ various responses to natural climate change, including gradual adaptions both physically
                        and behaviorally to the new environment, or migration to a new suitable area. Organisms unable to overcome these shifts typically face extinction. The nature of human induced
                        climate change since the industrial era. however, has seen an increase in global temperature at an alarming rate due to depletion of ozone layer and
                        increased carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere. Thus, honeybees are unable to develop genetic changes quick enough to adapt to the rapidly changing climate.
                        The other option is migration towards the poles and higher altitudes; however, they may be introduced into a foreign environment and may respond to different temperature cues than normal. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-0 mt-4">
                        As introduced earlier, both honeybee behavior and physiology can be influenced by the shifting temperatures induced by rapid climate change, which directly affects a colony's ability
                        to harvest food and sustain itself for an extended period of time. The phenological process of honeybee pollination often depends on environmental cues related to temperature; since honeybees are
                        ectothermic, they require an elevated body temperature above a certain threshold to maintain flight. Thus, behavioral responses to rapidly increasing temperatures may detract from time spent on harvesting pollen, and therefore 
                        negatively impact the frequency of pollination services. For example, bees with a body weight above 35mg are capable of endothermic heating; however, the time it takes for thermoregulation to compensate for extreme temperatures
                        limits the amount of opportunities for foraging, leading to the colony's starvation. Other behavioral responses related to hive development, such as queen egg-laying cycles, coincide with seasonal changes. 
                        Specifically, queens begin laying eggs in mild ambient weather, typically during the spring; however, shifts in ambient temperature may interfere with this phenological 
                        process and lead to a gradual decrease of a hive's population.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="mt-5">Honeybee and Floral Mismatches from Climate Change</h2>
                    <p class="mb-0">
                       In addition to affecting honeybee physiology and behavior, global climate change also directly affects flower development and nector pollen production, which bees rely on for food.
                       Specifically, many flower species face a reduction in the production and nutritional quality of pollen in drier climates, which adversely affects the surrounding bees' ability to
                       sufficient honey stores for the winter. Additionally, an insufficient pollen diet weakens honeybee immune systems and makes them more vulnerable to pathogens â€” another threat to
                       the colony's lifespan and the integrity of pollinator-plant relationships.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-0 mt-4">
                        Moreover, the biological timings of both honeybees and their food sources may adapt differently in response to the drastically changing temperatures, creating temporal and spatial mismatches.
                        These mismatches may cause plants to experience reduced insect pollination, while insects may struggle finding their respective food sources. For example, increased spring temperatures may induce
                        a postponed blooming time for flowers, while pollinators remain unaffected. This mismatch leaves insects without food and plants without pollinators, causing both populations to struggle without a stable 
                        plant-pollinator relationship.
