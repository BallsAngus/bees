                    <p class="mb-0">
                        While managed honeybees are responsible for providing stable pollination to agriculture and wild plant communities, wild bee species are also significant providers of
                        pollination services. However, there has been increasing evidence that many species of wild bees and pollinators, such as bumblebees, are declining in either range or abundance. 
                        Among numerous threats described on this site and other research, habitat loss seems to be the biggest contributer to this decline in recent decades. This page specifically details the
                        degradation of natural pollinator habitats for agricultural use and the resulting impact on pollinator populations from primarily a quantitative perspective, using expert input to explain
                        data trends and uncertainties.

                        The following visual provides a map detailing wild bee abundance, which we can treat as the potential pollination supply of a region, and associated uncertainties:

                        </figure>
                        From the information displayed on each map, we have:
                        <ul>
                            <li>A - Status of wild bee abundance (relative index) for 2013.</li>
                            <li>B - Uncertainty (SD estimate) of wild bee abundance index for 2013.</li>
                            <li>C - Trends in wild bee abundance and its uncertainty (the likelihood of changes: pseudo-t values) between 2008 and 2013. </li>
                            <li>D - Status of supply of wild bees (model-predicted abundance from A) and demand for pollination services 
                                (summed area of animal-pollinated crops, weighted by their pollinator dependence) at a county scale for 2013. 
                                Counties with less than 1,000 ha of pollinator-dependency weighted crop area were left white. </li>
                            <li>E - Uncertainty in the supply of wild bees in 2013 for the counties identified as supply/demand mismatches in D. </li>
                            <li>F - Trend of supply and demand between 2008 and 2013 (zones I and II indicate high and low likelihood of decreases in supply, respectively).</li>
                        </ul>
                        To generalize the results yielded from the source paper's study, wild bee abundance was found to be consistent in 67% of the US land area between 2008 and 2013; however,
                        the model demonstrates decreases in the other 23%, and these decreases were found to be highly likely in 9% of the US. The majority of decreases were concentrated in agricultural regions
                        of the Midwest, including the Great Plains states and Mississippi river valley. Within this region, eleven states contributed to 60% of the areas of predicted decrease in wild bee abundance; these eleven
                        states have also witnessed a corn and grain cropland increase by 200% and 100%, respectively, replacing regions that denoting intermediate abundances such as grasslands and pastures.
                        Moreover, from the maps themselves, we can see higher abundances in resource-rich areas such as chaparral and desert shrublands, more mild abundance levels in temperate forest and 
                        grassland regions, and lower levels of bee abundance in agricultural regions, corresponding to the abundance decreases found from the study. Furthermore,
                        most areas of low abundance share a low level of uncertainty, implying that experts are more certain about poor bee habitats compared to suitable ones,  which can 
                        vary depending on time and other physical elements within the environment.

                            <figcaption class="figure-caption text-md-end">Source: "Modeling the status, trends, and impacts of wild bee abundance in the United
                                States" - Insu Koh</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        From the figure above, we can see the bee abundances were likely to decrease in land converted for agriculture (A), notably corn and grain, while shrublands and grasslands (B) — more suitable
                        wild bee habitats — were more likely to see bee abundance increases. Thus, from the mapped index of bee abundance and land use data, we can clearly see that areas of intense agriculture are at the 
                        most risk for low bee abundnance. Recent trends also reflect this conclusion, where land converted for agricultural use in recent years have also reflected a trending decrease in bee abundance, while land
                        converted in the opposite direction tended to have an upwards trend in bee abundance.

                    <h2 class="mt-5">How This Affects Bees</h2>
                    <p class="mb-0">
                        A resource-rich habitat with open land is necessary for bees to have enough foraging resources and suitable nesting sites for a healthy hive. The loss of natural land covers and habitats for agriculture and urbanization
                        limits the amount of resources bees have access to, reducing both the likelihood of a bee returning to its hive and the overall honey production of the colony. Urban areas, while providing some
                        sources of nectar via small gardens and wild flowers, simply provide inadequate resources for larger hives. These land shifts may also reduce the diversity of available flora, potentially eliminating
                        food sources most beneficial to specific species of bees. For example, bumble bees prefer nectar with higher protein contents, visiting flowers providing this nectar with greater frequency.
                        In addition to reducing the efficiency of foraging, nutritional stress may also impact the immune system of the workers, rendering them weak against pathogens and diseases. Less resources for bees means they are unable to sustain the development of brood,
                        and the metabolic demands on cold days when they are already at risk from pathogens. Beekeepers have also expressed their concern for domestic colonies, citing starvation and poor foraging conditions
                        as primary causes of population loss, demonstrating that both wild and managed bee colonies, and thus their pollination services, are both negatively impacted by recent land converstion trends.
