                    <h2>Uncertainty of Bee Trends</h2>
                    <p class="mb-0 mt-4">
                        Currently, it is incredibly difficult to model bee population trends with a high degree of certainty due to the lack of long-term data on pollinator abundance. It is practically 
                        impossible to monitor all species on a global scale, and the required resources to conduct field assessments on suitable habitats are logistically challengling and expensive to acquire.
                        Observing population trends is necessary to document any changes in pollination services, for without proper knowledge of distributions, finding areas in critical danger of pollination
                        mismatches becomes difficult to both assess and resolve. Thus, as a substitute of field observations, many studies have turned to careful use of data models and expert input to forge a path
                        to global assessment of pollinator abundance in the absence of consistent data. Some studies have also turned to citizen science surveys, where volunteers take note of the number of insects they
                        see during their time outside; however, this is limited by both the number of volunteers and their available skills and resources. In the absence of efficient pollinator modeling, experts are 
                        unable to priortize management of critically endangered species, and we essentially have no early warning system against a pollinator crisis. So far, the only thing we can do is continue observing
                        trends with prediction models until a sufficient amount of data is collected, which will reduce the uncertainty experts have in their conclusions.

                    <p class="lead">Improving Landscape Management for Bees</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">
                        A solution that alleviates declines influenced by all three causes detailed on this site is the improvement of landscape policies among both natural ecosystems and agricultural regions.
                        The preservation of remaining natural areas would aid in the preservation of wild bee populations and their respective floral resources. Preservation of habitats in the central United States,
                        such as the tailgrass prairie, are especially important; they provide both nesting sites and food sources for various bee species, but are scarce due to a reduction in area over 
                        the past three centuries. For areas that have already undergone significant change, especially agricultural areas, miniature habitats in the form of native flower plantings or floral strips (shown below) would
                        provide a stable source of nectar for native wild bees. This also provides farmers with an economic incentive to grow insect-pollinated crops, since the established seminatural habitats
                        increases pollination for surrounding crops. Shelterbelts and hedgerows can provide nesting sites and wind breaks for bees that require specific nesting conditions.

                        </figure>
                        However, the management of natural areas for ecosystem services is still executed poorly or sporadically. More information is required in order to strike a balance between land reserved
                        for agriculture and land reserved for such services, which can only be acquired once we have concrete sources of data. Pollination is not the only service that is protected by land management;
                        soil erosion control, enhanced water filtration and water quality, and increased species richness of beneficial arthropods all benefit from established hedgerows of native vegetation. These practices,
                        unfortunately, are not widely practiced in the United States due to the expenses required for establishing such habitats, as well as the concern of financial return and upkeep. Despite these concerns,
                        natural plantings have been revealed to require little upkeep a few years after establishment, especially when compared to field management strategies of mowing and herbicide use. Moreover, a 
                        cost-benefit model predicted a return on investment 5 to 16 years after establishment, although this will likely vary from region to region due to local landscape conditions. Crop diversity and wildflower plantings
                        also assist with monoculture landscapes, providing additional floral resources to bees and thus increasing species abundance. To assist bees with making needed adjustments to climate changes, ensuring connectivity
                        of natural habitats in agricultural regions will allow them to easily disperse and gather resources prior to seasons requiring more thermoregulation.

                    <p class="lead mt-4">Reducing the Spread of Pesticides and Pathogens</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">
                        Bees are currently highly exposed to multiple pesticides that either directly kill the insect itself or exacerbate other lethal stressors, such as pathogens and parasites. Pesticide use has risen dramatically
                        since the 1990s due to a reduction in cost relative to labor and crop expenses; however, current levels of pesticide use are not necessarily required to maintain the same level of yield in modern day farms. A
                        proposed solution to reducing pollinator exposure is a return to the principles of integrated pest management (IPM), which depends on methods such as crop rotation for defense against insect pests. Some European
                        countries have attempted to take action by enforcing pesticide minimization programs, but this has had little to no impact on farming practices. The EU has also attempted to use policy change to reduce bee exposure
                        to stressors, particularly neonicotinoids; however, if this encourages farmers to merely switch to different, similarly harmful pesticides, the effect of the policy would be negligible. Funding for both research on
                        pesticide impacts, population trends, and advice for farmers on efficient pesticide use and IPM practices could prove to be more sustainable in the long term. For pathogens and invasive species, strict quarantine procedures
                        when moving commerical bees, natural nest conditions, and the prevention of deliberate invasive species introductions should all be enforced.

                    <h2 class="mt-5">What Can You Do?</h2>
                    <p class="mb-0">
                        When looking at an issue that is caused by multiple environmental factors acting in tandem, as well as practices within a specific industry, it can be difficult to take action and identify ways that would directly
                        alleviate the current pollination crisis. Simple, cost-efficient measures such as reducing the frequency of mowing, planting native wildflowers to elevate the availablity of floral resources, maintaining a diverse
                        garden, or showing support for individuals pushing for beneficial policies are all ways we can make a difference as individuals.
