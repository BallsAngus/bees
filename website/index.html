                        <p class="lead">As a result of many human-driven factors, the bees may face extinction.</p>
                        <p class="mb-0">Many species of bees — most notably honey bees — are responsible for the majority of pollination worldwide. Their services impact both the sustainability of natural ecosystems
                            and essential pollination to many US crops, contributing to an estimated 11% of the nation’s agricultural gross domestic product in 2009. However, global species richness and abundance of pollinators 
                            have declined in the last 50 years, which could impact flora in natural environments and the availability of critical produce. This website aims to cover the various causes and effects of this issue
                            by addressing the following four key questions.

                        <p class="mb-0 mt-4">In addition to providing information on the causes of this issue, this website will also be providing an overview of the impacts of a drastic pollinator loss, with a specific focus on the environmental changes and socioeconomic implications.</p>
                        <p class="mb-0 mt-4">To give a brief outline of our key questions and content:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <p class="lead mt-4">What are the causes behind pollinator loss?</p>
                            <li>The primary causes this website will be covering is climate change, pesticide use, and habitat loss. Essentially, these three elements interfere with many pollinators' biological processes, and even the production of pollen in necessary plants, which impedes
                                on their ability to maintain a healthy hive.
                            </li>
                            <p class="lead mt-4">What are the environmental impacts of pollinator loss, especially bees?</p>
                            <li>A reduction in the pollinator population can drastically influence ecosystems that relies on pollinator-plant interactions. Many sources of food for herbivores depend on bees for pollination—their
                                loss would result in a shift in the food chains and perhaps even the extinction of various different species in the wild.
                            </li>
                            <p class="lead mt-4">How does this issue affect our supply of resources, notably among the agriculture industry?</p>
                            <li>Many popular crops, especially in the United States, directly rely on pollination in order to yield fruits. Failure to maintain a proper pollinator-plant interaction can directly affects humanity’s food supply.</li>
                            <p class="lead mt-4">What are some possible solutions behind mitigating the population reduction of pollinators?</p>
                            <li>Many have proposed solutions to alleviating the issue of a reduced pollinator population, which includes improving honeybee responses to changing climates, 
                                restricting the use of dangerous pesticides and reducing human intervention in common pollinator habitats.
