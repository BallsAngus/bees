                            This review article details research conducted and compiled by Rami Reddy, Abraham Verghese, and Varun Rajan concerning the honeybee population decline and its link 
                            to climate change. It initially addresses the global decline of various honeybee species, providing a table as a clear visual of population loss in the last 10 to 
                            20 years across multiple countries. The major reason attributed to this loss—and the major focus of the article—is the consequences of increased temperature on 
                            pollinator-plant interactions. Essentially, the rapid temperature changes in recent years may affect not only honey bee physiology and behavior, but the production 
                            of pollen in necessary plants, impeding on their ability to maintain a healthy hive. The article then discusses the societal consequences of the issue, primarily 
                            focusing on the failure to pollinate popular crops, which directly affects humanity’s food supply. The final section is dedicated to proposing possible solutions to 
                            the problem, such as restructuring farming areas to better improve honeybee responses to changing climates.

                            In this paper, multiple researchers gathered data on wild bee abundance and uncertainty in the United States by utilizing a spatial habitat model, 
                            land-cover data, and quantified input from experts in ecology and biology. Results from this data collection have revealed that modeled bee abundance 
                            has decreased in many regions of the United States, with 139 counties having a mismatch between supply, or bee abundance, and demand, or the cultivated 
                            area intended to be pollinated. Additionally, crops highly dependent on pollinators have been demonstrated to retain a severe mismatch with the increasing 
                            demand and decreasing supply. The credibility of the issue is also cemented by the clear correlation between low bee abundance and its low uncertainty, 
                            leaving many researchers certain that the decline is facilitated by the degradation of pollinator habitats. If this trend should continue, agricultural 
                            costs in the US may increase, and can possibly result in the destabilization of crop production altogether.

                            In this paper, Dhruba Naug of the Deparment of Biology at Colorado State University observes the correlation between recent land conversion trends and bee population declines. From Naug's
                            study, he finds that recent changes in land cover for agricultural use have limited the amount of floral resources available for bees, restricting their colony development due to the lack of 
                            food. Naug also finds that bees deficient in energy due to limited availbility of nectar from habitat loss renders colonies vulnerable to pathogenic infection and lower temperatures. To demonstrate these
                            losses, Naug plots trends of colony loss and honey development versus open land areas, revealing that open land areas are critical to colony health, which have been 
                            in decline primarily due to urbanization and agriculture.

                            This article, by Olivia Kline and Neelendra K. Joshi, also observes trends in pollinator habitat loss, with a specific focus on solitary bees and other wild pollinators, primarily due to
                            the prevalent research on social and domestic bees. Their study details how land with high agricultural intensity coincide with high rates of bee decline, and observes specific impacts
                            on various species of wild bees. For example, mason and leafcutter bees use natural materials, such as mud and leaves, to construct their nests in the cavities of tree trunks and branches. Carpenter bees
                            chew their own holes in wood to carve their own nests. This diversity of nesting preferences relies on diverse physical conditions within a habitat, which is eliminated when a land is converted to a
                            more uniform site for farming. The study also describes how a reduction in biodiversity in habitats reduces the available of specific flora; for example, bumble bees have a preference for pollen with a higher protein content,
                            meaning they are more likely to visit flowers bearing this kind of pollen. Finally, the paper offers recommendations for mitigating the issue and implications for the future should trends increase or decrease.

                            and increased pesticide use for agricultural management. It becomes clear from their study that stressors do not work in isolation, but often exacerbate the effects of one another; for example, increased insecticide use,
                            particularly neonicotinoids, interferes with bees' immune systems at a sublethal level, and thus renders them vulnerable to pathogens they otherwise would have resistances to. The article also discusses possible solutions to

                            This article observes declines in bumble bee populations in both Europe and the United States, focusing on habitat loss, declines in floral abundance, and reduction in biodiversity due to
                            agricultural intensification. It also attributes losses in the United States due to introductions of nonnative parasites from Europe. From the study's conclusions, its
                            authors recommend regulation of commercial bumble bee use to prevent pathogenic infections, and agricultural management changes to encourage floral diversity. The study also reveals
                            social impacts of pollinator reduction, questioning both the stability of crops that rely on pollination and the agriculture industry as a whole.

                            This source's information on habitat loss and biodiversity overlap with other scholarly articles, reinforcing their credibility; however, the section on both the economic and crop output of
                            pollination prove useful for demonstrating social consequenecs should these declines continue.

                            This article discusses the environmental implications of pollinator population declines. To summarize, angiosperms relying on pollinators may face extinction should decreases continue,
                            while other insect species, such as moths, beetles, and butterflies, are facing similar declines in population from shared causes. This risks both environmental biodiversity as well as the
                            integrity of biological processes in the natural world, for insects are responsible for multiple natural phenomenon, such as decomposition, pest control, and food for larger organisms.

                            This source focuses more on how pollinator decline impacts environmental health, while the other sources on this list focus more on the socioeconomic impacts of population drops. This adds
                            another perspective to the impacts page of the website, revealing that not only are humans at risk in a pollinator crisis, but the rest of the natural world as well.
