                    <h2>Environmental Impacts of Pollinator Decline</h2>
                    <p class="lead">"If
                        insects were to disappear, the environment would collapse into chaos." - E.O. Wilson</p>
                    <p class="mb-0 mt-4">
                        Many species of bees are an essential aspect of natural ecosystems and agricultural development due to their pollination services. As much as 80% of wild angiosperm species are pollinated
                        by animals — the majority relying on various species of bees. Thus, not only are many species of flowers and plants at risk of extinction, but a reduction in floral biodiversity would mean their
                        respective pollinators could potentially face extinction as well, due to the mutual dependence between pollinators and pollen producers. Additionally, a decline in bee populations has numerous other 
                        environmental implications regarding different insect species. Similar trends of decline has been observed in other insect species; for example, long-running declines of moth and butterfly species have
                        been monitored in the UK, particularly those associated with farmland habitats. A recent study revealed that 76% of butterfly species in the UK declined in either abundance or occurrence in the past 
                        four decades, with moths and carabid beetles following similar trends. In the United States, “ubiquitous” declines were discovered in lowland California butterfly species between 1975 to 2009, with many 
                        studies observing pernicious effects of habitat loss and agricultural intensification on these species. Declines linked to neonicotinoid use have also been observed; for example, farmland butterflies in the 
                        UK have been declining at an accelerated rate, with trends correlating to an increased use in neonicotinoids. Thus, a decline in bee populations could be indicative of a decline in insect diversity and abundance due 
                        to similar trends in decline, which are mostly facilitated by human practices. Not only do they provide pollination services, they are respondible for a plethora of other natural phenomenon: decomposition, pest control,
                        and food for larger organisms. The rapid loss of insect populations risks the biodiversity of natural ecosystems and the very integrity of numerous biological processes.

                        Crop production also relies on bee pollination; around 9.5% of total worldwide agricultural production encompasses 
                        pollination services. This contribution makes up an estimated 15-30% of the human diet, including both the direct pollination of produce consumed by humans, and the pollination of 
                        plants, such as alfalfa and clover, used to feed livestock. In the United States, pollination services contributed an estimated 11% of the nation’s agricultural gross domestic 
                        product in 2009, and estimated $3.07 billion annually comes from the plants pollinated by wild bees. While bee populations have been in decline, consumption of specialty fruit and vegetable
                        crops, as well as the rate of growth for the human population, has grown exponentially. Pollinator demands have only increased as time progresses, and pollinators are unable to keep pace, risking
                        the health of popular crops within the agriculture industry, as well as popular food sources in the human diet, such as almonds, cherries, blueberries, apples, watermelons, and squash. Crops such as
                        mangoes, litchi, and coffee have periods of mass blooming over relatively short periods, raising the likelihood of pollinator mismatches due to human activity. These trends are modeled in the following graph,
                        showing changes in dependency for different crops within the United States:

                        </figure>
                        Specialty crops, such as pumpkins, blueberries, peaches, apples, and watermelons, were revealed to bave the strongest mismatch between changes in supply and demand. It is clear from the graph that
                        most crops that rely on animal pollination have expanded in area and production, and thus demand, while the predicted supply of wild bees in these areas have declined. Should these trends continue,
                        costs for US farmers may increase and crop production may even destabilize over time due to the lack of pollination services. This directly affects global food sources for humans as well, negatively impacting
                        the output of fresh produce and livestock.
