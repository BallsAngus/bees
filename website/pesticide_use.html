                    <h2>Pesticide Use and Bees: Overview</h2>
                    <p class="mb-0">
                        Pesticide use is among the more controversial and debated causes of bee declines. They provide numerous economic benefits in the agriculture industry, preventing damage to crops and maintaining a stable
                        output of products; however, their use may also clash with the welfare of bees and eventually do more harm than good to the agricultural market. Moreover, herbicide use, while efficient in 
                        minimizing weed populations to maximize resources for crops, may reduce the availability of flowers for nectar and thus render the farmland uninhabitable for pollinators.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="mt-5">Direct Effects of Pesticide Use</h2>
                    <p class="mb-0">
                        Pesticide use with respect to bee health often focuses on the toxic effects on bees themselves. Of 161 different pesticides discovered in honey bee colonies, 
                        three neonicotinoids (thiamethoxam, imidacloprid, and clothianidin) and two organophosphates (phosmet and chlorpyrifos) were found to pose the biggest risk to
                        bee populations globally. Of these pesticides, neonicotinoids were implied to be the strongest contributor to bee declines. They are potent neurotoxins that target the acetylcholine receptors
                        of an insect, causing overstimulation, paralysis, and death. These pesticides are typically applied as seed treatments, which means they gradually become present throughout the entire plant, spreading into
                        plant tissues, nectar, and pollen. They are also water-soluble, and thus can spread to nearby wildflowers through soil and soil water. Consequently, it is incredibly easy for bees to ingest neonicotinoids
                        Sublethal effects in honeybees have also been observed to be detrimental to individual growth, impacting worker learning, foraging ability, and homing ability.
                        From these risks, it seems that bees living in agricultural areas are likely to suffer lethal and sublethal effects from neonicotinoids due to their widespread use; however, whether this poses a risk at the
                        colony level itself, or even pose to be a signficant contributor to global species declines, remains disputed due to difficulties monitoring key stages of bee development at the colony level.

                    <h2 class="mt-5">Pesticides Exacerbate Other Risks to Bee Health</h2>
                    <p class="mb-0">
                        Thus, while pesticides are capable of directly killing bees or inducing harmful side effects, their main risk lies in exacerbating other stressors to colony development — notably pathogens and parasitic infections.
                        Neonicotinoids and other insecticides have been found to induce immune suppression effects on bees, contributing to the increasing negative impact of parasitic infections observed in bees in recent decades.
                        Specifically, <em>Nosema ceranae</em>, a pathogen that infects gut epithelial and the most widespread disease inflicting adult bees, was first found in honey bee colonies in the United States in 1995 — around the same period
                        neonicotinoids as effective pesticides for arable land. When bees infected with <em>Nosema ceranae</em> were exposed to neonicotinoids, they were unable to sterilize colony food sources, facilitating the spread of
                        the pathogen within the colony. If the pathogen was present within a healthy colony, honey bees are usually capable of resisting spread and health risks through their natural immune systems; however, pathogen growth is likely to
                        accelerate in the presence of lethal and sublethal toxins, as well as poor diets from compromised food sources.

                        This diagram provides a visual on how different interacting stressors impact colony development. Pesticides inhibit both a bee's immune systems and food sources, rendering them vulnerable against pathogens they would 
                        normally have resistances against.
